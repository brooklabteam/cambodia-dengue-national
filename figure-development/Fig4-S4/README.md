# This folder contains the script to generate Figure 4 of the main text and Fig S5 of the supplement.

The main script is "fig4.R". It generates figure 4. You can find the final figure "fig4.png" in the folder "final-figures", and input files in the folder "data" or folder "BEAST-tree" for "DENV1avg.tree" and "DENV2avg.tree". Additionally, the script "make-beast-metadat.R" generates the file "beasttree_metadata.csv" which is found in the "data" folder and used to generate these figures.
