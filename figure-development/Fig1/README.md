# This folder contains the script to generate figure 1

The main script is "fig1.R". It generates all four subplots a-d. You can find the final figure fig1.png in the folder "final-figures"

## Input files for "fig1.R"
The "make-tsir-data.R" builds the TSIR-structured data.
The "generate-combined-tsir-increased-S-increased-beta-dataset.R" fits all the TSIR models and builds the datasets that are called for plotting.

The "old-scripts" folder contains previous runs and can be ignored and eventually removed.
